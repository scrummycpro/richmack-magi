# Magi-App

Magi-App is a Flask-based web application for managing notes. The application supports adding, editing, viewing, searching, and exporting notes. It also allows uploading files associated with notes.

## Features

- **Add Notes:** Create new notes with optional file uploads.
- **Edit Notes:** Update existing notes and change uploaded files.
- **View Notes:** View detailed notes with associated files.
- **Search Notes:** Search notes based on prompts and responses.
- **Export Notes:** Export search results and individual notes as text files.
- **User Authentication:** Simple login and logout functionality to protect note management.

## Requirements

- Docker
- Docker Compose (optional, but recommended)

## Directory Structure

```
/magi-app
    /templates
        add_note.html
        edit_note.html
        index.html
        note_detail.html
        search.html
    app.py
    requirements.txt
    Dockerfile
    README.md
```

## How to Run

### 1. Build the Docker Image

Navigate to the directory containing the `Dockerfile` and run the following command to build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t magi-app .
```

### 2. Run the Docker Container

Run the Docker container with the following command:

```bash
docker run -p 5005:5005 -v $(pwd):/app magi-app
```

This command maps the container's port 5005 to the host's port 5005 and mounts the current directory to `/app` in the container. The Flask application will be accessible at `http://localhost:5005`.

## Application Endpoints
